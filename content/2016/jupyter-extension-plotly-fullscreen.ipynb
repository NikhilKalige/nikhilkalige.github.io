    "[Plotly](https://plot.ly/) is a new plotting library that supports an array of languages. It also supports python and most importantly it can be used to plot offline and integrates very well with [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. It thus serves as a good alternative for existing popular libraries like [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I have always been attracted towards pretty UI's and plotly excels at generating them without any effort on your part and you can argue that you can generate pretty graphs using matplotlib too. I would not disagree against that point as I am currently using [seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to do the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me come to the point, I needed to generate graphs for my robot optimization task and the process would generate lots of data and I needed the data to be plotted in real-time(not real real-time). By this time I was in love with plotly and I wanted to make it work with plotly. I had a few requirements for that.\n",
    "1. The graphs needed to be big, as the plots in jupyter notebooks are very small.\n",
    "2. The graphs should be able to update itself as data gets added.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started off to accomplish the first part and this brings me to this post on how I created a jupyter extension to create full-screen graphs for plotly. Jupyter has good [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/frontend_extensions.html) on how you can extend the notebook by creating custom frontend extensions. I wanted to add a button that could then be used to expand the graphs to occupy the entire real estate of my big screen.\n",

    "Jupyter extension [Ploty-Fullscreen][1] can be installed and enabled using the following commands\n",

    "The `Jupyter` variable contains a lot of functionality and the `events` can be used to listen to events generated by the notebook in a style similar to jQuery. The button is created by listening to two events\n",
    "1. `kernel_ready.Kernel` - We listen to this event because we want the graphs to have a button when we first load the notebook.\n",
    "2. `plotly_afterplot` - Plotly generates this event after the graph has been plotted.\n",
