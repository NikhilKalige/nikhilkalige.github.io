        <p>Hacking is a mysterious and common word today with increased number of websites and people having become the victim of hackers. So when I was assigned the task of hacking a VoIP phone as a part of the interview process for a security company, I was at the end of my wits. So let me explain how I approached and solved the&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>The task started off with a phone being mailed to me as well as a sheet of paper with clues. The first clue&nbsp;was</p>
<ul>
<li>ssh/admin/admin&nbsp;h1m0mz</li>
</ul>
<p>So using this clue, I was able to ssh into the phone with user: admin and password: admin. But the shell that I entered had limited access. So I used nmap to search for all the open ports on the&nbsp;device.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> nmap -sV ip_address

<span class="go">Host is up (0.0086s latency).</span>
<span class="go">Not shown: 998 closed ports</span>
<span class="go">PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION</span>
<span class="go">22/tcp open  ssh     Dropbear sshd 2013.58 (protocol 2.0)</span>
<span class="go">80/tcp open  http    mini_httpd 1.19 19dec2003</span>
<span class="go">Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The above information helped me know which services are running and their version information. I used this information to check the Internet and see if there were any remote execution bugs but was unable to find&nbsp;any.</p>
<p>I still had not found any use for the second part of the first clue <em>h1m0mz</em>. I accidentally entered this in the terminal, and this showed up in the&nbsp;terminal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> h1m0mz

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication">challenge-response</a> authentication system, and I had no idea about the secret key that I&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>So I looked at the second&nbsp;clue.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might want to do some&nbsp;soldering.</li>
</ul>
<p>I started examining the <span class="caps">PCB</span> of the phone, after close inspection I came to the conclusion that the only part that could exploit was the <span class="caps">SPI</span> serial flash. I also found it hard to locate the datasheet for the chip as the markings were not very clear. But based on experience working with these chips, I knew that the manufacturers try to keep the pinouts similar so that they are pin to pin compatible with other devices. The flash had eight pins and by looking for common flash chips, I was able to find the appropriate&nbsp;pinouts.</p>
<figure><img alt="SPI flash pinouts" src="/images/2016/hacking-soic.png" /><figcaption><span class="caps">SPI</span> flash pinouts</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I started by looking at the spi signals, and the clock speed was very high at around 50 MHz. I used a <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">Buspirate</a> to try to read the flash chip. <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom">Flashrom</a> is an excellent piece of software that can be used to read and write flash chips and it also supports Buspirate. I tried to read the flash, and I did not get any valid response, but during the process, I was able to find that the name of the flash chip was <span class="caps">GD25Q128C</span> by [GigaDevice][http://www.gigadevice.com]. I desoldered the flash and tried to read it again, and I was successfully able to read the contents of the flash to <span class="caps">PC</span>.</p>
<figure><img alt="BusPirate" src="/images/2016/hacking-buspirate.jpg" width="500" /><figcaption>BusPirate</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first thing I did after I read the flash was to run <code>strings</code>. But looking at the first few lines like the one below, I came to the conclusion that I had endianness&nbsp;problem.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">tooBfvd v 99.2.1-1.6 2cr2102.40.( 10 nuJ2 22 51061 -:72: )139bve-819ipsq</span>

<p>I wrote a small program in C to fix the&nbsp;problem.</p>

<p>The above string after fixing the endianness got converted to an valid readable string as&nbsp;below.</p>

<p><a href="http://binwalk.org/">Binwalk</a> is an awesome firmware analysis tool. Binwalk reads the flash file and does a search for different file type signatures and in the end gives you information about the location of various file partitions like uboot, filesystem, etc. It can also extract them for you too. Binwalk gave the following info for my&nbsp;file.</p>

<p>I was able to extract the contents using the following&nbsp;command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">binwalk -e image_file</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Binwalk extracted the system directories, and I was now able to see all the files in the root directory. Now, I had to find the executable responsible for the limited shell. I searched for the string <em>h1m0mz</em> in the entire file system and was able to find the right&nbsp;executable.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> grep -rns <span class="s2">&quot;h1m0mz&quot;</span> *
<span class="go">Binary file sbin/config matches</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After disassembling the file and inspecting the flow of the code, I came across the section below where three strings were being concatenated using <code>sprintf</code>.</p>
<figure><img alt="sprintf section" src="/images/2016/hacking-ida1.png" width="420" /><figcaption>sprintf section</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first part of the string was the challenge value printed onto the console and second part of the string was being read from non-volatile ram using <code>nvram_get_safe(2)</code> which had its value set to <code>admin</code>. You can also see from the above figure that the concatenated strings are passed on to <code>MD5</code> function. By now I had all the necessary components to generate the response&nbsp;string.</p>
<p>I was very excited about my progress, and I directly jumped to my jupyter notebook and used the following to get the&nbsp;md5sum.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def generate_response(challenge):
    secret = &#39;:no more secrets:&#39;
    pwd = &quot;admin&quot;
    c_str = challenge + secret + pwd
    md5 = hashlib.md5(c_str.encode()).hexdigest()
    result = md5[:16]
    print(result)

$ generate_reponse(&#39;6f4a767546f02d16&#39;)
6949c6c6eda6c92c
</pre></div>


<p>I entered the above string in the ssh terminal, and I got no response. I was very disappointed and had to find a different way to solve the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page">Qemu</a> is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer that can be used to emulate arm architecture. I tried to run the executable using Qemu and to my surprise, I was successfully able to execute the program without any problems after I had fixed the paths for the library&nbsp;files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> qemu-arm sbin/config

<p>I wanted to use <code>gdb</code> to debug the code and stop at the point where the string entered in the terminal was being compared to the one generated internally. So I started the gdb server on Qemu and stepped through the&nbsp;code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">T1&gt; qemu-arm -g 23946 -L ./ sbin/config</span>

<figure><img alt="strcmp section" src="/images/2016/hacking-ida2.png" width="250" /><figcaption>strcmp section</figcaption>

<p>The first breakpoint coincides with <code>sprintf</code> function call and second with <code>strcmp</code>. Arm architecture uses registers <em>R0</em> to <em>R4</em> to pass the arguments to the&nbsp;functions.</p>

<p>I entered the string obtained from the gdb and entered into the console of the phone, and I got the following&nbsp;response.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> h1m0mz

<p>I used <code>find</code> to locate the <em>oem</em> file, and one more trick I learned was to use <code>nc</code> to transfer files over the&nbsp;network.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">find . -iname oem</span>

<p>After finding the <em>oem</em> file and executing it, I was able to locate the bitcoin key. And now I could finally call myself a&nbsp;Hacker.</p>
